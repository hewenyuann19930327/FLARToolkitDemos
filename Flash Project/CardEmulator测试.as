	         *        The CardEmulator represent a simple system for testing an AR Marker with
	 
	         * needing to use a webcam as a source. This class creates an instance of a
	 
	         * Papervision 3D renderer, viewport and scene with a simple 3d plane skinned
	 
	         * with a texture of your marker. When render is called the mouse is tracked
	 
	         * and the plane is adjusted to test your pattern at different angles.
	 
	
	
	
	         * 
	         * This since this class requires a reference to stage for the mouse
	 
	         * calculations you must attach it to the stage or another display object.
	 
	         * In cases when you don't want to see the viewport you can optionally toggle
	 
	         * addViewportToDisplay in the constructor.
